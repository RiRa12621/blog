_"Inception: the beginning of an organization or official activity"_ -
[Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/inception)


While it does sound a bit dramatic, it does fit my purpose very well.

This is the beginning of an "official activity"...kind of. There is nothing
official about it, but this is the very first entry, that I'm writing in my
blog. Now one could ask why I'd want to start a blog, it's 2021 afterall, but I
just thought it's a nice to have and also a neat guinea pig. No one's going to
cry if my blog is offline for a bit so I can freely play around and deploy it
how and where I want.

This first one is also a rather short one, but next topic is going to be "GitHub
Actions and CloudRun: deploy a blog super fast", which is basically explaining,
how this blog is currently deployed.

Until then...
